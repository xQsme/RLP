# Regenerator Location Problem
In optical networks, the strength of an optical signal deteriorates as it gets farther from the source due to transmission impairments in the fiber (attenuation, dispersion, cross-talk). In other words, the distance an optical signal may be sent without losing or falsifying the information is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to regenerate the signals periodically using regenerators. Given an optical network, the regenerator location problem searches for the subset of regenerators to be installed at minimum cost, so that each pair of nodes can communicate with each other.
